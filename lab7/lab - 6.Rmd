## Part 3)
A point set with real values is given in 2020_em_clustering.csv. Considering that there are two clusters, use EM to group together points belonging to the same cluster. Try and argue that k-means is an EM algorithm.
```{r}
library(mclust)
```

```{r}
content <- read.table("C:\\Users\\SIVASAI\\Downloads\\2020_em_clustering.csv", sep = ",")
content
```


## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(t(content))
df
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# using this mclust package for estimation maximization algorithm
train_data <- Mclust(df, G=2)
summary(train_data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# 1D plot for the data with classification
```


```{r}
mclust1Dplot(df$V1, parameters = train_data$parameters, z = train_data$z, what = "classification", xlab = "points position")
```
ff
```{r}
# 1D plot for the data with uncertainty
mclust1Dplot(df$V1, parameters = train_data$parameters, z = train_data$z, what = "uncertainty", xlab = "points position")
```
```{r}
data <- kmeans(df$V1, centers = 2)
data
```
```{r}
plot(df$V1, data$cluster, xlab = "points position", ylab = "Classification", col = ifelse(data$cluster>1.5, "red", "blue"), pch="|")
```
